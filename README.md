# Portfolio Project 

This repository is a personal project where I am self teaching myself HTML and CSS, Javascript, and also practicing UI/UX design. 
I'm utilizing Github Pages to have a domain for my website.

This website is very much so a work in progress, and is currently only being used as a portfolio to archive artworks/animations/graphics/etc. 
Eventually I will develop it into my professional page!
